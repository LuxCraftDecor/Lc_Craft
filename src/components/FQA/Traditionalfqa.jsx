        title="The Birth of Impressionism"
        answer="Impressionism, born in Paris, was a bold departure from traditional art forms. It emerged as a response to the rapid changes in society and technology, reflecting a new way of seeing the world. Impressionist artists broke free from the constraints of realism, focusing instead on the play of light, color, and the immediacy of the moment."

      <Accordion title="The Artistic Essence" 
      answer="The hallmark of Impressionist art is its vivid use of color and loose, seemingly spontaneous brushwork. Impressionist painters sought to capture the fleeting effects of light and atmosphere, often painting en plein air (outdoors) to directly capture the essence of the scene before them. This approach resulted in works that shimmer with vibrancy and life, offering a fresh perspective on everyday scenes and landscapes." />
